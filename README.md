# Jam Challenge #001: non-cyclic baseline

## Prerequisites

* lein 1.3.x (http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen)
* git
* a JVM
* music mojo

## Setup

Clone this repo (or clone your own fork of it if you use Github)

run ./init-jam-challenge

## Initial Run

Obviously use whatever developing tools you're used to. If you just want to test that you can produce sound, lein repl will work for you:

lein repl
